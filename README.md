Plans for Snake Game as we know them so far
iPhone (+Android) app tentatively called "Snake Game: The Pythoning", 
using a probability engine to determine the results of ball python breeding combinations. 
We will need to make a cursory list of common Ball Python genes and assign their probability. 
This information is easy to find on the internet. 
We will need to make pixel art for each snake we want to use, as well as for the few characters we have designed.
